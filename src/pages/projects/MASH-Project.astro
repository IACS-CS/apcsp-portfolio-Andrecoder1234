  title="Mash Project"
  assignment= "Build a game using React which uses lists and strings. The project is named the MASH project because MASH is one such game: you tell someone's fortunes by compiling a list of possibilities (MASH stands for possible domiciles: Mansion, Apartment, Shack or House), and then traditionally using a counting method, you choose among the options to tell the users fortune.(we could create other simple games like that)"

  <p>For this project I worked with Addario to create a IACS themed uncrabling game. It took us a while to figure out how to get the code for the game to work but after that it was easy all that was left to do was make sure there wasnt any weird errors and that everything ran good!</p>
